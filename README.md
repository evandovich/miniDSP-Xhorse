# miniDSP-Xhorse

This code implements various Digital signal processing carried out on a received signal. The obtained signal could be energy and power signals, periodic and aperiodic signals,or symmetric and antisymmetric signals. This code release does not include the synthetic raw data signal used, so the user can provide or generate their own waveform data information.

The code is implemented using Codeblock IDE and the required packages are listed in requirements.txt. To implement a module, navigate to the folder and run the main.c file. The resultant data file will be saved automatically, and user can plot the obtained data using plot program of choice. For this project, we used GNU plot for all modules setting. Hence it is highly recommended to have an installed GNU plot or see some online materials to download and run dataset on GNU plot dataset.
